sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: Tested with random50000.txt, reversed50000.txt and sorted50000.txt.
Getting the run time of sorted50000 is significantly less than the other two that
match the bubble sort which has Big-O(n2) but Big-Ω(n).

sort2 uses: merge sort.

How do you know?: Tested with random50000.txt, reversed50000.txt and sorted50000.txt.
Run time nearly the same indicate that it does not use the method bubble sort.
Tested with random5000.txt and compare the running time with the one of
testing with random50000.txt. The comparison shows the algorithm follows
O(n logn) indicate the algorithm is merge sort.


sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: result of testing with random5000, random10000 and random50000 shows the algorithm
follows Big-O(n2). running time of testing with sorted50000 is about the same as
random50000 indicate that it follows Big-Ω(n2) hence the algorithm must be
selection sort.
